= Comments Extension

Adds blog-like comment functionality to Radiant. 

== Patches

This software "works for me", but it may not work for you, depending on your particular environment or setup. Feel free to modify it in any way. If you do make changes that would be useful to others, please send a patch to ryan at artofmission (dot you-know-what), and I will see that it gets applied. 

== Dependencies

* Requires Radiant 0.6.1 or greater. 
* Requires the Shards extension (http://dev.radiantcms.org/svn/radiant/trunk/extensions/shards)
* Requires will_paginate Rails plugin (svn://errtheblog.com/svn/plugins/will_paginate)


== Usage

Remember to run the migration. This _WILL_ delete any snippets named 'comment', 'comments' and 'comment_form' if these exist.

=== Link Spam filters

You can filter spam through Akismet or LinkSleeve.

==== Akismet
Set Radiant::Config["comments.spam_filter"] = "Akismet".
Also remember to add a akismet key to the Comment model.

==== LinkSleeve
Set Radiant::Config["comments.spam_filter"] = "LinkSleeve" (or leave it blank - this is the default, because LinkSleeve is both free and config-free, and Akismet requires both registration and payment for commercial projects).

=== In your layout: 

  <r:snippet name="comments" />

=== Snippets

The snippets "comments", "comment" and "comment_form" are created by the migration. These can be found under snippets, and can be customised after your needs. The snippets are the following:

=== Snippet: comments

<r:if_comments>
 <h2>Comments</h2>
 <r:comments:each>
   <r:snippet name="comment" />
 </r:comments:each>
</r:if_comments>
<r:snippet name="comment_form" />
	

=== Snippet: comment

<div class="comment">
 <span class="number"><r:index />.</span>
 <span class="by_line">
   <r:author_link /> wrote:
 </span>
 <div class="message">
   <r:content />
 </div>
</div>

=== Snippet: comment_form

<r:if_comments_enabled>
 <r:comments:form>
   <h2>Post a Comment</h2>
   <p>
     <label>Name</label>
     <r:author_field class="textbox" />
   </p>
   <p>
     <label>E-mail <small>(not shown)</small></label>
     <r:author_email_field class="textbox" />
   </p>
   <p>
     <label>Website</label>
     <r:author_url_field class="textbox" />
   </p>
   <p>
     <label>Text Filter</label>
     <r:text_filter_field />
   </p>
   <p>
     <label>Message</label>
     <r:content_field rows="9" cols="40" />
   </p>
   <div class="buttons">
     <input type="submit" value="Post Comment" />
   </div>
 </r:comments:form>
</r:if_comments_enabled>
